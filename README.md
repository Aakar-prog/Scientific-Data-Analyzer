# Scient# Scientific Data Analyzer

A simple Python toolkit for basic scientific data analysis, including:

- CSV data loading
- Mean and standard deviation computation
- Linear regression
- Data visualization

This project is intended as a learning-oriented scientific analysis framework.

---
## Design Philosophy

This project is intentionally designed as a minimal but extensible scientific
analysis framework. The focus is on reproducible research practices, including:

- modular code organization
- automated testing
- clear documentation
- version control transparency

Rather than feature complexity, the project emphasizes correctness,
readability, and extensibility, which are essential for scientific computing
at the graduate level.


## Features

- Load experimental data from CSV files
- Compute statistical quantities (mean, standard deviation)
- Perform linear regression
- Plot data and fitted curves
- Unit tests for core functionality
